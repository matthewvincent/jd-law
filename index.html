                  <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Trusts In A Nutshell:</h4>
                  <p class="page-body">
                    With respect to Estate Planning, trusts are either inter vivos (created by living person(s), whether revocable or irrevocable) or testamentary (created by court order upon the death of some person). They can be loosely analogized to corporations. When a corporation is created, ownership of property is transferred to the corporation, and thereafter the corporation owns that property. When a trust is created, ownership of property is transferred to the trust, and thereafter the trust owns that property. The shareholders have an ownership interest in the corporation itself, but the corporation owns the assets, not the shareholders. The beneficiaries of a trust are analogous to the shareholders of a corporation - they have an interest in the trust, but the trust owns the property, not the beneficiaries. And just as the chief executive officer of a corporation is charged with managing the property owned by the corporation, so the trustee of a trust is charged with managing the property owned by the trust. The “corporation” analogy stops there.

                    With respect to Revocable Living Trusts, the trust’s “ownership” of those assets held in the trust is what is known as a “legal fiction,” authorized as a matter of public policy and governed by the California Probate Code. Ownership of property/assets by a Revocable Living Trust is a “legal fiction” because, until the death of the trust’s creator(s), the trust can be revoked or terminated at any time for any reason by the one(s) who created it; hence, the trust’s creators never lose management and control of her/his/their assets and remain the de facto owners of that property. Trust us, the IRS and the Franchise Tax Board know it’s a legal fiction.

                    The point is, person(s) who place their property/assets in a living (inter vivos) trust, whether revocable or irrevocable, no longer have any property or assets to “probate.” She/he/they don’t own the property - the Trust does. Hence, he/she/they have no estate to probate. This is how and why property held in trust avoids probate.

                    Probate courts and financial institutions love inter vivos trusts. Every time an inter vivos trust is created it means one less file on the desk of a probate judge somewhere (except when there’s some legal challenge respecting creation of the trust or management of the trust, or respecting terms of the trust). Fact is, by far the vast majority of inter vivos trusts run smoothly and efficiently. Very few trusts end up in litigation relative to the sheer number of trusts in existence. Banks and financial institutions also love them because they facilitate the efficient management of assets.

                    Irrevocable inter vivos trusts are a special breed of trusts designed to shelter assets and/or transfer assets across generations, or for other particular or specific purposes. I estimate that more than eighty percent of all persons and couples who wish to create a trust do not require an irrevocable trust - indeed would shun such a trust, being, as they are, irrevocable. The creator of an irrevocable trust can, indeed, lose actual ownership of the assets placed in the irrevocable trust. As stated, they are a specialized breed of trust.

                    The Law Office of Jeffrey L. Daniel specializes in Revocable Living Trusts and Testamentary Trusts. As noted above, a testamentary trust can only be created by court order. This typically occurs when a person’s will specifies that a trust be created upon that person’s death, or when a deceased person attempted while living to create an inter vivos trust but the trust failed for some reason (e.g., not properly executed, or not properly funded, etc.). Because testamentary trusts are created by court order, they cannot be amended or revoked without a court order. Revocable Living Trusts are created inter vivos (“among the living”) and can be amended or revoked, either in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason.

                  <p class="page-body">
                      Post-death Trust Administration occurs after the creator(s) of a Trust have passed away. Until that time a Revocable Living Trust is administered typically by the ones who created the Trust, who are under neither duty nor obligation to give an accounting to anyone. She/he/they are the de facto owners of the property in question. However, upon the death of the Trust’s creator(s), the successor trustee(s) owe a fiduciary duty to the final beneficiar(ies) to manage the Trust Estate in a manner that maximizes the value of Trust assets and minimizes any losses thereto, and further, to account for his/her/their actions respecting Trust assets at least annually, and finally to facilitate and effect the final distribution of the Trust estate.

                      Although probate is unnecessary with respect to property held in Trust, before final distribution of the Trust Estate can occur there are a number of mandatory steps required by the California Probate Code, many of which are similar or identical to steps required in probate court, but without court supervision. Mr. Daniel is highly skilled at Trust Administration. He has personally guided numerous successor trustee(s) respecting her/his/their fiduciary duties to final beneficiaries, and respecting the steps mandated by the California Probate Code regarding the marshaling, management, accounting and final distribution of Trust assets upon the death of the Trust’s creator(s). Moreover, because of his background and experiences (see Our Story), Mr. Daniel has proven himself particularly effective in helping to resolve issues that often arise between and among successor trustee(s) and/or final beneficiar(ies).

                      Trust Administration is, like any other legal process, a specialized area of law, containing many traps for the unwary. It is highly recommended that successor trustee(s) contact the Law Office of Jeffrey L. Daniel with regard to post-death Trust Administration.

                  <p class="page-body">
                    The probate of an estate is the judicial supervision (i.e., by a court of law) respecting the marshaling (gathering) of a decedent’s assets, paying the decedent’s creditors and final expenses, filing and paying final income taxes for the decedent (if any), paying inheritance taxes for the decedent’s estate (if any), identifying and notifying the final beneficiar(ies) of the estate, submitting an inventory and appraisal of estate assets and an accounting of the estate representative’s actions in regard to all the above, and lastly, preparing for and effecting final distribution of the estate assets to the beneficiaries of the estate.

                    Probate commences upon filing a Petition for Probate in the appropriate court of law. The court names a personal representative of the estate, who is then endowed with the legal authority to complete the actions above.

                    A distinction must be made between a “probate estate” and a “trust estate.” Property held in trust is called a Trust Estate, and as such is NOT subject to probate. That is because the person who created the trust does not “own” the property, the trust owns the property, so there is nothing to probate. (See Trusts in a Nutshell, above). Property not held in trust, or by some other means (e.g., joint tenancies, beneficiary accounts, etc.) does not pass free of probate, is called the decedent’s Probate Estate.

                    A decedent’s Probate Estate is either testate (the decedent had a Will) or intestate (decedent had no Will). If a person thinks she or he has no estate plan, the state has a surprise for that person - California has an estate plan custom made just for him or her. It’s called “intestate law” and is governed by the California Probate Code. Be assured, under intestate law, your property may not devolve to the person(s) you would prefer to give it to.

                    Probate procedure can be “formal” or “summary.” If the gross value of a decedent’s Probate Estate is $150,000.00 or less, then the personal representative of the estate may utilize one of the summary procedures specified in the California Probate Code that streamline the judicial process (far less judicial intervention). The cut-off is $150,000.00 in gross assets (including real estate). If the gross value of the Probate Estate is $150,000.01 or higher, then the “formal” probate procedure must be endured. Lastly, the Personal Representative of the decedent’s Probate Estate, as well as the attorney for the estate, are entitled to a statutory fee paid from the estate. The Personal Representative is not expected to work for free.
                    Mr. Daniel is highly skilled in the probate of Decedent’s Estates, having personally and successfully probated numerous estates, both testate and intestate.

                    PLACING A PERSON UNDER A CONSERVATORSHIP OR GUARDIANSHIP IS A DRASTIC MEASURE

                    <br>
                    WHERE THE PERSON IN QUESTION IS ENTITLED TO A JURY TRIAL
                  </h4>
                  <p class="page-body">
                    A conservatorship or guardianship is the judicial supervision (by a court of law) of a person and/or that person’s estate. Both conservatorship and guardianship are governed by the California Probate Code. As a general rule, a guardianship applies to minors and a conservatorship applies to adults. People with diminished mental capacity (adults or minors) and minors who have no authority over them in loco parentis (i.e., no parent(s) nor anyone standing in the shoes of a parent, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc.) are primary candidates for these judicial procedures. Other situations also apply.

                    There are two types of conservatorship or guardianship. A conservatorship or guardianship “of the person” involves judicial supervision of a person’s welfare: food, clothing, shelter, health, education, etc. A conservatorship or guardianship “of the estate” involves judicial supervision of a person’s assets and finances.

                    Whether a person requires a guardianship or conservatorship must be evaluated on a case by case basis. For example, a conservatorship of a person’s estate may not be indicated for an adult person who, prior to becoming incapacitated, created a living trust or executed a durable power of attorney for finances; or, if an incapacitated person, prior to incapacitation, executed a durable power of attorney for healthcare and an advance healthcare directive (living will), and the person is being properly cared for by her or his healthcare agent, then a conservatorship of the person may not be indicated. On the other hand, If you suspect or believe that a loved one, whether a minor or an adult, is not being properly cared for under any circumstances, or is being abused in any fashion, or the person’s finances are being mismanaged, then judicial intervention may be appropriate to supervise the care of that person or her or his estate.

                    As noted above, placing a person under a conservatorship or guardianship is a drastic measure. It is one of the few areas under the California Probate Code where the person in question is entitled to a jury trial, involving as it does such a severe intervention in a person’s life. If you believe or even wonder if someone you love should be placed under a conservatorship or guardianship, Mr. Daniel strongly recommends that you set an appointment with him to determine if a conservatorship or guardianship is appropriate under the circumstances.

                      The eviction process is not as straightforward as many think. There are many defenses to an Unlawful Detainer action, and many consumer laws exist to protect tenants. By the same token, land owners are not required to sit idly by while their property is being wasted or when tenants will not or cannot pay rent. An unlawful detainer based on a 3-day notice is a summary action at law, and as with all summary actions, strict compliance with statutory procedure is mandatory or the case can be thrown out (dismissed) and the part(ies) must start all over again.

                      Unlawful detainer based on a thirty-day or sixty-day notice is not summary procedures, but again the land owner must comply with strict procedural requirements. Mr. Daniel is highly experienced at all types of eviction process, from the side of the land owner as well as the side of the tenant.
